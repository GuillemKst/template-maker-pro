# üîß Text Rendering Issue - Solutions

## The Problem
Sharp (SVG to PNG converter) on Vercel has trouble rendering text properly, especially with:
- Complex font families
- Emoji characters  
- Advanced SVG features

## ‚úÖ Solutions Available

### Option 1: Use Local Canvas Version
The **Canvas version works perfectly locally** (30KB images with proper text).

**For self-hosting:**
```bash
# Run locally or on VPS with Canvas support
npm run dev:canvas
```

### Option 2: Switch to External Service  
Use a reliable image generation service like:
- htmlcsstoimage.com API
- Bannerbear API
- Placid API

### Option 3: Return SVG to Discord/Telegram
Many platforms support SVG images directly:

```javascript
// Change the API to return SVG instead of PNG
res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'image/svg+xml');
res.send(svgContent);
```

### Option 4: Alternative Deployment Platform
Deploy to platforms that support Canvas:
- **Railway** (supports Canvas)
- **Render** (supports Canvas)  
- **DigitalOcean App Platform**
- **Heroku**

## üöÄ Quick Fix - Railway Deployment

Railway supports Canvas perfectly:

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Deploy
railway login
railway init
railway up
```

## üìù Recommendation

**For Production:** Deploy the **Canvas version** to Railway or Render instead of Vercel.

**Vercel is great for many things, but image generation with Canvas works better on other platforms.**

Would you like me to help you set up deployment on Railway instead?
